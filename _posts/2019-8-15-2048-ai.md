[2048](https://play2048.co/) was no doubt the hottest game of 2014. There was a
certain joy in being one of the first people to hit 2048, and talking with
friends about what the optimal strategy could be. I always thought that 2048
would be a really good example of applying a genetic algorithm, i.e. figuring
out a strategy, applying it, mutating the strategy, seeing if it scores higher,
picking the strongest performers, and so on.

So at this point, we all intuitively know to put the largest numbers in the
corner; however is there a way we can make the AI learn this knowledge from scratch?
[Ovolve's AI](https://github.com/ovolve/2048-AI) uses a minimax approach, but
I'm wondering if we can have an AI that performs a random walk and picks the
best move to make based on future simulations of that move. You can check it
out [here](http://jkgh20.github.io/2048-AI).

**TODO**: Add strategy mutation, write up an explanation and clean up this post.
