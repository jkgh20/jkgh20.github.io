Hello! My name is John Kim and I'm a software engineer currently working at
[Appian](https://www.appian.com/). I grew up in the suburbs of northern Virginia
just outside of Washington D.C. for most of my life. I attended the University
of Virginia and graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2017. I lived in
Salt Lake City, Utah for a period of time after graduating college, but have
since moved back to Virginia.

If you would like to contact me for job opportunities, you can reach me via
email: `jkj7420 at gmail dot com`. Resume and references available upon request.

## Professional

### Appian (2016 - Present)

I interned at [Appian](https://www.appian.com/) in 2016 and came back for a
full-time position the following summer. Although it is my first job, I truly
believe the culture is second to none. There is a strong push to work together
and help others without being penalized for taking your eyes off of your own
goal just for a second (I know that in some companies this is not the case).
Appian has also been voted a "Top Workplace" by the Washington Post for several
consecutive years, for whatever that's worth.

As an intern, I worked on shipping various mobile features for the iOS and
Android Appian app. When I came back in 2017, I was first on the DevOps team to
revamp the customer's CI/CD process, then on one of the product teams to add
third-party integration support to the Appian platform, and finally on the
infrastructure team to improve our internal engineering development tools using
AWS.

### Comscore (Summer 2015)

I interned at [Comscore](https://www.comscore.com/) in 2015. This was my first
software engineering internship, and my first actual experience with big data.
I had to aggregate a 7 trillion dataset containing internet cookie data for site
usage patterns by human users, and optimized it from 12 to 6 hours to complete.
I also had to crunch another dataset to determine non-human internet traffic
from web browser data. Since interning, I've been delighted in noticing how
prevalent Comscore is cited in the number of studies that aggregate media and
internet usage data.

## Personal

I love to think deeply about things. My favorite classes in university had to do
with compilers, interpreters, and programming languages/paradigms. I also took
several classes in physics and mathematical analysis (just short of picking up
another degree in either, regrettably). I have interests in history, literature,
philosophy, environmental science, geography, maps, music theory, and many
others.

I love being in touch emotionally. When I was younger, I used to believe one
could intellectualize themselves out of any predicament, but I have since walked
back from that point of view. I enjoy art that provokes deep-seated feelings
about ourselves and others; perhaps I'll write about those which have been most
influential to me. I actively try to practice gratitude for everything I have in
life, and empathy for those without. I often value relationships over "things",
and I believe there are more problems than we think that cannot be solved by
technology alone.

I love using my body. I firmly disagree with a lifestyle that
presumes we are merely brains in a vat. The best vacations I have are when I
exert myself to full exhaustion instead of relaxing. I like to hike, run, ski,
climb, lift, bike and eat healthy. I prefer to be outdoors over staying inside.
I hope to learn how to backcountry ski soon.
