Hello! My name is John Kim and I'm a software engineer currently working at
[Appian](https://www.appian.com/). I grew up in the suburbs of northern Virginia
just outside of Washington D.C. for most of my life. I attended the University
of Virginia and graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2017. I lived in
Salt Lake City, Utah for a period of time after graduating college, but have
since moved back to Virginia.

I love to think deeply about things. My favorite classes in university had to do
with compilers, interpreters, and programming languages/paradigms. I also took
several classes in physics and mathematical analysis (just short of picking up
another degree in either, regrettably). I have interests in history, literature,
philosophy, maps, music theory, and many others.

I love to feel emotions. When I was younger, I used to think one could
intellectualize themselves out of any predicament; I have since walked back from
that viewpoint. I enjoy art that provokes the Dionysian side of our nature
(perhaps I'll write about those which have been most influential to me). I
actively try to practice gratefulness for everything I have in life, and empathy
for those without.

I love using my body. I firmly disagree with a lifestyle that presumes we are
merely brains in a vat. The best vacations I have are when I exert myself to
full exhaustion instead of relaxing. I like to hike, run, ski, climb, lift, bike
and eat healthy. I prefer to be outdoors over staying inside. I hope to learn
how to backcountry ski soon.

If you would like to contact me for job opportunities, you can reach me via
email: `jkj7420 at gmail dot com`.
